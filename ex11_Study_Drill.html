<h2><span style="color:blue">1. Go online and find out what Python's input does.</h2></span>
<h3>input([prompt])

<h2>If the prompt argument is present, it is written to standard output without a trailing newline.
The function then reads a line from input, converts it to a string (stripping a trailing newline),
and returns that. When EOF is read, EOFError is raised. Example:</h2>

>>> s = input('--> ')
--> Monty Python's Flying Circus
>>> s
"Monty Python's Flying Circus"</h3>

<h2><span style="color:blue">2. Can you find other ways to use it? Try some of the samples you find.</h2></span>
<h3>you can use it to pause a program, for example if displaying a text
file a page/screen at a time, or while debugging.
</h3>

<h2><span style="color:blue">3. Write another "form" like this to ask some other questions.</h2></span>
<h3><p>
