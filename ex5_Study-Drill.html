<h2><span style="color:blue">1) Change all the variables so there is no my_ in front of each one. Make sure you change the name everywhere,
    not just where you used = to set them.</h2></span>
    <h3>Same results just aneater, cleaner code block</h3>

<h2><span style="color:blue">2) Try to write some variables that convert the inches and pounds to centimeters and kilograms.
    Do not just type in the measurements. Work out the math in Python.</h2></span>
    <h3>Multiply inchehs by 2.54 to get centimeters, and one pound equals 0.45359237 kilograms.</h3>

<h2><span style="color:blue">3) Search online for all of the Python format characters.</h2>)</span>
<h3>Flag	Meaning
#	The value conversion will use the ``alternate form'' (where defined below).
0	The conversion will be zero padded for numeric values.
-	The converted value is left adjusted (overrides the "0" conversion if both are given).
 	(a space) A blank should be left before a positive number (or empty string) produced by a signed conversion.
+	A sign character ("+" or "-") will precede the conversion (overrides a "space" flag).</h3>
<h3>Conversion	Meaning	Notes
d	Signed integer decimal.
i	Signed integer decimal.
o	Unsigned octal.	(1)
u	Unsigned decimal.
x	Unsigned hexadecimal (lowercase).	(2)
X	Unsigned hexadecimal (uppercase).	(2)
e	Floating point exponential format (lowercase).
E	Floating point exponential format (uppercase).
f	Floating point decimal format.
F	Floating point decimal format.
g	Same as "e" if exponent is greater than -4 or less than precision, "f" otherwise.
G	Same as "E" if exponent is greater than -4 or less than precision, "F" otherwise.
c	Single character (accepts integer or single character string).
r	String (converts any python object using repr()).	(3)
s	String (converts any python object using str()).	(4)
%	No argument is converted, results in a "%" character in the result.</h3>

<h2><span style="color:blue">4) Try more format characters. %r is a very useful one. It's like saying "print this no matter what."</h2></span>
<h3>It calls repr() on the object and inserts the resulting string.</h3>
