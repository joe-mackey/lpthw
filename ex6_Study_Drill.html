<h3><p># Sets variable x to string with an embedded format string. Format strings
# are way to insert (embed) a thing within a string such that the final
# output will include the thing or whatever operation the thing is part of.
x = "There are {!a} types of people.".format(10)

# sets variable 'binary' to 'binary' = redundant slightly but needed
binary = "binary"

# sets variable 'do_not' to 'don't'
do_not = "don't"

# Sets variable y to string with two embedded format strings
# (binary and do_not)
y = "Those who know {binary} and those who {do_not}."

print(x)
print(y)

# Print the RAW output of the x variable inside the string
# (that's what !r does) So x get's printed with quotes around it even
# though not specificed in this string. Also, Notice how the format string
# from x also caries through to this string. Format strings seem to cascade
# and output through levels of strings.
print("I said: {x!r}")

# Output string with called variable but not output RAW so needs quotes
# around format string to display in output. If you don't specify a conversion
# flag the `__format__()` method for that value will do the formatting -
# I think this means if you insert digits it'll format as digits,
# text as a string etc.
print "I also said:'{y}'."

hilarious = False
joke_evaluation = "Isn't that joke so funny?! {!r}"

# Here you learn that you can set the content of the format string 'later'
# by creating the format string in one variable yet specifying it's
# 'content/operator' at print time. Here the variable 'hilarious' is set as
# the format string at print time, which will output False in the final print.
# This seems powerful behaviour.
print(joke_evaluation.format(hilarious))

# Shows that you can add variables together. This just literally seems to
# concantenate the two together rather than any mathematical operation.
# Yep, + concantenates strings. Don't use + to concantenate more than 2
# strings though as this is highly inefficient.
# Instead use ''.join e.g ''.join((w,e))
w = "This is the left side of..."
e = "a string with a right side."

<h2><span style="color:blue">2. Find all the places where a string is put inside a string. There are four places.</h2></span>
<h3>1 & 2 on line 11 when print  y is called.
3 on line 14 variable x is called
4 on line 16 variable y is called.
line 16 calls variable y string in a string so credit 2 occurances.</h3>

<h2><span style="color:blue">3. Are you sure there are only four places? How do you know? Maybe I like lying.
Could be 6. See above.</h2</span>
<h3>Not a lie just a confusing situation I had to google to find</h3>

<h2><span style="color:blue">4. Explain why adding the two strings w and e with + makes a longer string.</h2></span>
<h3>concatenation is not a efficient way of joining two or more strings. Which will slow to program if they are very many occurances. The more efficient join is the best practice.</h3>
