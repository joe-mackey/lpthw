<h2><span style="color:blue">1.) Done for the difficult maths entries. The print statements otherwise are very obvious.</<h2></span>
<h3>The math lines took a minute but the print lines are simple.</h3>

<h2><span style="color:blue">2.) Remember in Exercise 0 when you started python? Start python this way again and using the math operators, use Python as a calculator.
Gave it a go, it works.</h2></span>
<h3>I was expecting to have to jump through hoops but it is simple and strightforward,</h3>

<h2<span style="color:blue">>3.) Find something you need to calculate and write a new .py file that does it.
This was too redundant. You can add calculations to this file or do study drill 2. There's a limit to useful repetition.</h2></span>
<h3>Enough is enough</h3>h

<h2><span style="color:blue">4. Rewrite ex3.py to use floating point numbers so it's more accurate. 20.0 is floating point.</h2></span>h
