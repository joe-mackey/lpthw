<h2><span style="color:blue">1. Do your checks, write down your mistakes, and try not to
    make the same mistakes on the next exercise.</h2></span>
<h3>What me make mistakes? I do not have room for them all. Just assume the worst!</h3>

<h2><span style="color:blue">2. Notice that the last line of output uses both single-quotes
    and double-quotes for individual pieces. Why do you think that is?</h2></span>
<h3>Best practice calls for double quotes at the begining and single quotes inside.
    This protocol makes most things simpler. Unless you
    consider thrpile single quaots. wheich honestly still confuses me.</h3>
