<h2><span style="color:blue">When I wrote this program the first time I had a mistake, and Python told me about it like this:
Traceback (most recent call last):</h2>

  File "ex4.py", line 8, in <module>
    average_passengers_per_car = car_pool_capacity / passenger
NameError: name 'car_pool_capacity' is not defined


<h2><span style="color:blue">Explain this error in your own words. Make sure you use line numbers and explain why.
    Explain this error in your own words. Make sure you use line numbers and explain why.</h2></span>
<h3>car_pool_capacity has not been defined. The compiler does not know what it is or where to find it. </h3>

<h2>Here are more study drills:</h2>

<h2><span style="color:blue">I used 4.0 for space_in_a_car, but is that necessary? What happens if it's just 4?</h2></span>
<h3>Remember that 4.0 is a floating point number. It's just a number with a decimal point,
    and you need 4.0 instead of just 4 so that it is floating point.</<h3>

<h2><span style="color:blue">Write comments above each of the variable assignments.</h2></span>
Make sure you know what = is called (equals) and that it's making names for things.
Remember that _ is an underscore character.
Try running python from the Terminal as a calculator like you did before and use variable names to do your calculations.
     Popular variable names are also i, x, and j.
     <h3>Same results</h3>
